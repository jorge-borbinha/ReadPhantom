# ReadPhantom: Voxel phantom data processing for PENELOPE simulations

A Python script to read, process, and convert voxel phantom data into files suitable for simulation and visualization with the PENELOPE/penEasy framework. ⚛️

The `ReadPhantom.py` script is a powerful tool designed to streamline the workflow for researchers and students working with voxel phantoms. It automates the conversion of raw phantom data—which can be either in ASCII or binary format—into structured output files required by PENELOPE/penEasy. This program is a modern Python re-implementation of a similar tool originally written in Fortran.
